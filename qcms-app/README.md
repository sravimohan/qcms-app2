# QCMS Application

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## For AI Assistants ðŸ¤–

When working with this codebase, please note:

- **Project Type**: QCMS (Quality Content Management System) built with Next.js 15 and React 19
- **Monorepo Structure**: Contains qcms-app (main), qcms-form (forms), and ui (components)
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js + TypeScript + React Aria Components + Tailwind CSS + Biome
- **Package Manager**: Use `pnpm` (not npm/yarn)
- **Styling**: Tailwind utility classes with React Aria Components for accessibility
- **Code Quality**: Biome handles linting/formatting (replaces ESLint/Prettier)
- **Architecture**: Follow existing patterns in components/ and utils/
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required for all UI components

ðŸ“‹ See `.vscode/instructions.md` for comprehensive development guidelines and coding standards.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
